This is the program to process and format the given data using a data structure with properties: "name", color", "price", "storage", "rating", and "url" and returns a final output with the data sorted based on the price property.

This implementation is set to read in given data in the file named "input.json" and will write the output to a file named "output.json". 

	example:	$ python sortByPrice.py

It is configured so that another input file can be used to test by entering the file name in the command line after the original command.

	example:	$ python sortByPrice.py input2.json
